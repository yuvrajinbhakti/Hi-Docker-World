# Dockerizing a Simple Node Application

In this project, I created a Dockerfile for a simple Node.js application, built a Docker image from it, and then ran a container using that image. Additionally, I made the Docker image public by pushing it to DockerHub.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to containerize a Node.js application using Docker. The steps include:

1. **Creating a Dockerfile:** Defining the environment and dependencies for the Node.js application.
2. **Building a Docker Image:** Generating a Docker image from the Dockerfile.
3. **Running a Docker Container:** Launching a container from the Docker image.
4. **Publishing to DockerHub:** Making the Docker image publicly available.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Docker installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t yuvraj366/hidockerworld .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 yuvraj366/hidockerworld
   ```

   This will start the Node.js application inside a Docker container and map it to port 3000 on your local machine.

### DockerHub Image

The Docker image for this application is publicly available on DockerHub and can be pulled using the following command:

```bash
docker pull yuvraj366/hidockerworld
```

You can find the Docker image on DockerHub [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/yuvraj366/hidockerworld).

## Conclusion

This project serves as a basic introduction to Docker, demonstrating how to containerize a Node.js application and share it with others via DockerHub. By using Docker, you can easily package and distribute your applications in a consistent environment, reducing compatibility issues and simplifying deployment.
